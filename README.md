# Getting Started with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev).

1. This project was bootstrapped with [github](github.com).

2. Use Redux for state management

3. The task is to have a page with city search input, search button and vertical bar chart with temperature forecast
 for that city
 
4. Don’t display a chart, if nothing was searched or city is not found

5. If city is not found, display a proper message

6. City search and chart should be two separate components

7. Use [open weather map site](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) Here is the API key`bad46dfee1ae1125ec4faf31e63449de`. Even though we update this key regularly, it may get expired. In such case you have to get your own by signing up on [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_in)

8. In the case you don’t have a preference in HTTP requests libraries, we recommend [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)

9. In the case you don’t have a preference in charting libraries, we recommend [Recharts](https://github.com/recharts/recharts)

10. Keep UI simple to preserve time, you won’t be judged by its looks

11. Code must be linted

12. Use clear and complete commit messages
